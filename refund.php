	<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
	<p>At Ujjwal Keshwani Web Development Services, we strive to provide high-quality services to our clients. However, we understand that there may be circumstances where a refund is necessary. We have outlined our refund policy below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are not satisfied with the initial design concepts, you can request a refund before the design phase is completed.</li>
		<li>If we are unable to complete the project due to unforeseen circumstances or issues on our end, you will be entitled to a full refund.</li>
		<li>If you wish to cancel the project after the design phase is completed, we will provide a partial refund based on the work completed up to that point.</li>
		<li>We do not offer refunds for completed projects or services that have been delivered.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have any questions about our refund policy or would like to request a refund, please contact us at <a href="l/email-protection.html#375e59515877425d5d40565b5c52445f4056595e1954585a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1e777078715e6b7474697f72757b6d76697f7077307d7173">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
